COMP 490
Imports: From requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth, import sys, and requests

An API key is to be imported, a subdomain and form hash variables are needed to be changed to your own form's in the main.py file, the api key is not committed to the project on github.

The project gets info from my wufoo form and saves it to a text file.

Currently, no missing components are in Sprint 1 Project 1.
